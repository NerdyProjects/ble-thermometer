  * length: 38mm
  * width: 22mm
  * height: 18mm
  * first button mark
  * first extension of handle for extended stability

## Visual feedback
  * The PCB is quite far in the front, also the silicone around the battery is really thin.
  * There is ~5mm of unused space in the back
  * There is ~5mm of unused space below the PCB.
  * Button mark ("hole") is too small. Positioning is not right but if PCB is a bit further back this would be solved
 
## User feedback
  * Do not use transparent silicone as it might be creepy to the user

## Improvement suggestions
  * decrease length by ~3mm
  * move PCB a bit further to the back: Make sure it sits exactly in the middle and put enough of the viscous silicone in the front
  * have the battery side on the bottom when molding. PCB should be just on top of the mold form e.g. only battery/switch/LED underneath, PCB will be inside the second half.
  * Put a ring around the base of the device (maybe getting rid of the handle or not) to avoid the device from falling out
